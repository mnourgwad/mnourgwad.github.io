	<td><b>Abstract</b>: This paper presents the typical construction and operation of a practical technique that applies system identification with recursive parameter identification to a PWM commanded three phase BLDC motor actuating system to extract its accurate black box linear model. The implementation in MATLAB/Simulink of this technique is also presented. Model validation is provided, as an essential feature of the technique, by step response transient simulation of motor current feedback and shaft velocity and comparison with actual drive test data in addition to Hardware in the loop (HIL) simulations utilizing a real actuator to verify the accuracy of the derived models. Design, simulations, and experimental results are included in the paper. The derived model is successful deployed in controller design of a space robot, named SpaceClimber, joint actuators. The effect of different techniques to control the modeled joint actuators and the controllers design is also analyzed. From the results obtained, it can be concluded that using the proposed technique for the BLDC motor drive modeling and its controller design is very promising.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: This paper deals with the design of a hybrid optimal Genetic-Sliding Mode Control (GA-SMC) approach for VSC-HVDC transmission systems for improving the system's dynamic stability over a wide range of operating conditions considering different parameter variations and disturbances. For this purpose, a comprehensive state of the art of the VSC-HVDC stabilization dilemma is discussed. The nonlinear VSC-HVDC model is developed. The problem of designing a nonlinear feedback control scheme via two control strategies is addressed seeking a better performance. For ensuring robustness and chattering free behavior, the conventional SMC (C-SMC) scheme is realized using a boundary layer hyperbolic tangent function for the sliding surface. Then, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) is employed for determining the optimal gains for such SMC methodology forming a modified nonlinear GA-SMC control in order to conveniently stabilize the system end enhance its performance. The simulation results verify the enhanced performance of the VSC-HVDC transmission system controlled by SMC alone compared to the proposed optimal GA-SMC control. The comparative dynamic behavior analysis for both SMC and GA-SMC control schemes are presented.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The inspection of marine vessels is currently performed manually. Inspectors use tools (e.g. cameras and devices for non-destructive testing) to detect damaged areas, cracks, and corrosion in large cargo holds, tanks, and other parts of a ship. Due to the size and complex geometry of most ships, ship inspection is time-consuming and expensive. The EU-funded project INCASS develops concepts for a marine inspection robotic assistant system to improve and automate ship inspections. In this paper, we introduce our magnetic wall&amp;#8211;climbing robot: Marine Inspection Robotic Assistant (MIRA). This semiautonomous lightweight system is able to climb a vessels steel frame to deliver on-line visual inspection data. In addition, we describe the design of the robot and its building subsystems as<br>well as its hardware and software components.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: A key challenge in autonomous legged robots is the extraction of meaningful information from sensor data, which would allow a good interpretation of the nearby terrain, and a reasonable assessment of more distant areas. In order to navigate efficiently, legged robots need to assess the nearby terrain, avoiding obstacles and other hazards such as excessive tilt and roughness. Although the field of automated terrain classification is relatively new, its advances and goals are scattered across different robotic platforms and applications. In this paper, we present an automated terrain classification approach that works with a single camera and maintains high classification rates that are robust to varying lighting conditions. Terrain is classified using keypoint descriptors created from speeded up robust features (SURF) with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. This technique works by extracting salient features, and matching these to a database of pre-extracted features to perform the classification. We demonstrate the good performance of our approach with the results of the experiments done to classify patches of different terrain types.</td>

Our approach not only successfully optimizes the aerodynamic design but also yields interesting results from an engineering point of view. In this paper we describe an optimization method which evolves a manipulator arm morphology that requires minimal torques to accomplish these to some extent conflictive applications. Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy in parallel processing is used to optimize the link lengths of the manipulator arm.

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Interaction between a walking robot and its environment is one of the most important issues in robotic research. To achieve good dynamical locomotion behaviors such as compliance with unknown load on the walking pattern as well as for energy-efficient locomotion behaviors such as low friction, high-force fidelity, and large-force bandwidth are deeply related to the interaction between the robot and its environment. For a good walking behavior, the robot should be capable of efficiently handling the forces resulting from the physical contact between its legs and the environment. Pure motion control turns out to be inadequate because the unavoidable modeling errors and uncertainties may cause a rise of the contact force, ultimately leading to an unstable behavior during the interaction, especially in the presence of rigid environments. Force feedback and force control becomes mandatory to achieve a robust and versatile behavior of a robotic system in poorly structured environments as well as safe and dependable operation in the presence of humans. In this paper, different approaches to measure the interaction forces between a legged robot and the environment that can be used for impedance control of its joint actuators are proposed with In addition, the analysis of indirect force control strategies, conceived to keep the contact forces limited by ensuring a suitable compliant behavior to the robot foot, with no need for an accurate model of the environment and formulation of the indirect force control via motion control scheme. This formulation is the essential premise to the synthesis of a hybrid impedance (admittance to be more specific) force/motion controller scheme. The results of experiments performed in a realistic simulation framework along with some analysis of the terrain force interaction between robot leg and the ground are presented.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: In the development of our new electric car concept: EO smart connecting car 2 (EOscc2), a number of features and techniques are borrowed from the robotics domain (e.g., extended maneuverability of body parts, path planning and autonomous navigation). Although the added features help to simplify the tasks of the driver (e.g. parking in urban areas and driver inefficient control of the car), they also increase the complexity of the vehicle itself. In this paper, we present a practical framework and workflow for development and implementation of vehicle software components. This covers all activities from unit testing of single components to field experiments with the real car. The described framework is based on the rapid control prototyping (RCP) approach that is used for system development and enables modularity in the design of subsystems. The framework was successfully used for the development and implementation of actuators and motors low level control, kinematic calculation and path following algorithms. The performance of the designed modules is demonstrated through realistic simulations and real experiments. In the conducted simulations, the real car software modules are used in a software-in-the-loop fashion and in the real experiments, the software modules are interfaced with the real hardware, tested and verified. From the presented use-cases of the framework to validate hardware and software components and systems of the car, it is verified that this framework is indispensable, effective and adaptive solution as a development and test environment with the hardware platform. It reduces time and costs significantly for implementing component prototypes of the target system. Because of the benefits of the proposed framework and its capabilities as a realtime hardware interface, it is selected for the integration phase of the EO2 car as well as the development and optimization of most software components for the car control. Further conclusions, experience, outlook of future work are also given. %necessary to talk shortly about your conclusions here in the abstract.</td>

In this paper an approach is presented that constructs such a model using a genetic algorithm that evolves an artificial neural network using experimental data. The data is collected through a series of experiments performed with an industrial robotic arm equipped with a six axes force/torque sensor and a state of the art walking and climbing robot foot. The genetic algorithm evolves the structure and the parameters of the neural network which is represented with an indirect graph. In this paper only the modeling of the contact normal forces is presented, but the approach can be easily extended to include also the lateral force. The paper describes the neural network, the genetic algorithm, and the indirect graph representation. Moreover, the integration of the model into a full rigid body robot simulator is presented.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: future mission concepts ask for a fast and safe traverse through vast and varied expanses of terrain. As seen during the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) mission the rovers suffered a lack of detailed soil and terrain information which caused Spirit to get permanently stuck in soft soil. The goal of the FASTER1 EUFP7 project is to improve the mission safety and the effective traverse speed for planetary rover exploration by determining the traversability of the terrain and lowering the risk to enter hazardous areas. To achieve these goals, a scout rover will be used for soil and terrain sensing ahead of the main rover. This paper describes a highly mobile, and versatile micro scout rover that is used for soil and terrain sensing and is able to co-operate with a primary rover as part of the FASTER approach. The general reference mission idea and concept is addressed within this paper along with top-level requirements derived from the proposed ESA/NASA Mars Sample Return mission (MSR) [4]. Following the mission concept and requirements [3], a concept study for scout rover design and operations has been performed [5]. Based on this study the baseline for the Coyote II rover was designed and built as shown in Figure 1. Coyote II is equipped with a novel locomotion concept, providing high all terrain mobility and allowing to perform side-to-side steering maneuvers which reduce the soil disturbance as compared to common skid steering [6]. The rover serves as test platform for various scout rover application tests ranging from locomotion testing to dual rover operations.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The advanced simulation technology with the rapid growth of computing power leads many new approaches towards design of robot systems. In the typical top-down design of a robot system, the design of the lower phase would be limited by the design from the higher phase. Moreover, it is difficult to well-design the higher phase in predicting problems of the lower phase. Such problems can be effectively improved in the simulation-based system design. All design phases can be done simultaneously with the suitable simulation environment where the hardware and software properties can be flexibly selected and changed. In this paper, a simulation-based design approach of an extraterrestrial six-legged robot (named SpaceClimber) is presented. The highlevel system properties such as fitness functions, energy-efficient morphology and intelligent locomotions are designed in the realtime simulation. The low-level system properties such as joint motor, robot kinematics and dynamical control properties are designed in the precise simulation based on ADAMS/VIEW and MATLAB/SIMULINK.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: In the development of our new electric car concept: EO smart connecting car 2 (EOscc2), a number of features and techniques are borrowed from the robotics domain (e.g., extended maneuverability of body parts, path planning and autonomous navigation). Although the added features help to simplify the tasks of the driver (e.g. parking in urban areas and driver inefficient control of the car), they also increase the complexity of the vehicle itself. In this paper, we present a practical framework and workflow for development and implementation of vehicle software components. This covers all activities from unit testing of single components to field experiments with the real car. The described framework is based on the rapid control prototyping (RCP) approach that is used for system development and enables modularity in the design of subsystems. The framework was successfully used for the development and implementation of actuators and motors low level control, kinematic calculation and path following algorithms. The performance of the designed modules is demonstrated through realistic simulations and real experiments. In the conducted simulations, the real car software modules are used in a software-in-the-loop fashion and in the real experiments, the software modules are interfaced with the real hardware, tested and verified. From the presented use-cases of the framework to validate hardware and software components and systems of the car, it is verified that this framework is indispensable, effective and adaptive solution as a development and test environment with the hardware platform. It reduces time and costs significantly for implementing component prototypes of the target system. Because of the benefits of the proposed framework and its capabilities as a realtime hardware interface, it is selected for the integration phase of the EO2 car as well as the development and optimization of most software components for the car control. Further conclusions, experience, outlook of future work are also given. %necessary to talk shortly about your conclusions here in the abstract.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: In the development of our new electric car concept: EO smart connecting car 2 (EOscc2), a number of new features and techniques are to be implemented (e.g., extended manoeuvrability, path planning and autonomous navigation) to meet the requirements for future mobility demands.<br>This paper presents the developed control method based on rapid control prototyping for suspension and steering mechanisms of EOscc2. This method enables implementation and tests in hardware/software-in- the-loop fashions. We give a comparison between the used actuator types in terms of cost, weight, power, and mechanical features. The test results of the developed systems (speed, power) are also illustrated. In addition, a comparison of the developed software solutions (such as communication protocols, modular expandability, and platform dependency) is demonstrated. Some recommendations on the use of such actuators and an account of some of their merits and flaws especially considering weight and installation space are detailed.</td>
