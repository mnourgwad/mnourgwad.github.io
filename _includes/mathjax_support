The `mathjax_support` add the support for the MathJax. It must be used in the
`<head>..</head>` part of a HTML page.

With the MathJax support, you can use the LaTeX syntax to typeset mathematical
formula in your post:
 - Use `$$...$$` for inline formula.
 - Use `$$...$$` for display formula, but before the first `$$` and after the
   last `$$` there must be either an empty line, or a line with a single `^` 
   character.

Usage:
  1. include `mathjax_support`

Example:

The following is an example page layout:
  
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        {% include html_meta %}
        ...
        {% include mathjax_support %}
      </head>
      <body>
        ...
        {{ content }}
        ...
      </body>
    </html>

The following is an example post:

    Let $$z=x+iy$$ be a complex number, where $$x$$ and $$y$$ are real numbers,
    and $$i$$ is the imaginary unit. Let
    
    $$
     r=|z|^2 = x^2 + y^2
    $$
    
    be the norm of $$z$$. Then the complex number $$z$$ could be considered as
    a point $$Z$$ on the circle with the origin $$O$$ as its center and $$r$$
    as its radius.
